[Modeling Prosodic Phrasing with Multi-Task Learning in Tacotron-based TTS](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9166626)

Authors: Rui Liu, Berrak Sisman, Feilong Bao, Guanglai Gao, Haizhou Li.

## Audio samples

Examples of synthesized speech by "__Tacotron__" , "__WE-Tacotron__", "__PE-Tacotron__" and "__MTL-Tacotron__"system.

Speech samples are available at [speech samples page](https://ttslr.github.io/SPL2020/).


** **_Note: All speech samples are synthesized from Mel-spectrum by Griffin-Lim algorithm. Please only pay attention to the prosodic phrasing because this work is focused on prosody generation, it doesnâ€™t aim to improve the voice quality_**
