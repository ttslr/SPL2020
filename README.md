## Audio samples

Examples of synthesized speech by "__Tacotron__" , "__WE-Tacotron__", "__PE-Tacotron__" and "__MTL-Tacotron__"system.

Speech samples are available at [speech samples page](https://ttslr.github.io/SPL2020/).


** **_Note: These samples are synthesized from Mel-spectrum by Griffin-Lim algorithm. We just need to pay attention to prosody because this work has no relation with sound quality basically._**
